                    IoT Hackerpot allows its users to sense an invisible world of internet communications accordingly to which the HackerPot reacts. Its physical reaction informs the user of a possible malveillant intruder to make the person aware of this invisible presence. From this point, it is up to the user to define a way of dealing with this issue according to the type of alert received. This is a very promising first step into the direction of protecting the user's privacy by explicitly underlining the virtual abuse of rights happening in the network.

                    Icethetics interprets the encoded data from an ice core to reconstruct climatic records into an unique artistic representation. A visitor explores the encoded past using a primitive slider with a printing machine by positioning the arrow at the layer of interest and activating the printing. The printed receipt will provide a physical souvenir representing the fingerprint of certain Earth's age.

                    Netminded is a project that started based on the question: how can we create an interactive website which reflects a certain personality? We designed an AI simulation which imposes its mandates over the user. Netminded takes it’s own decisions by imposing its own personality.

                    This playful display is a decorative and tangible artifact. It has the advantage of being interactive rather than innanimate which enhances the user experience. A person can explore the magnetic field of any objects by using the "The Force".

                    Ring API is an Application Program Interface to interact with the headless Ring-daemon written in C++11. This project uses Cython for Python <-> C++ bindings. We wrap this with Python along with a RESTful web-server. It allows anyone to communicate with the daemon using a RESTful interface and to receive daemon-originated signals using WebSockets. It can be directly used in Python or through the latter web-interface.

                    Our goal was to raise awareness about the quantity of personal information available to everyone connected to a network. We accomplish this using a fun and interactive image board. The majority of people don't understand the network traffic. Knowing the OSI model and protocols by heart can be painful. We believe that our software will bring more people into networking by making visualization accessible and fun.
